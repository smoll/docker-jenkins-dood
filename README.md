[WIP] Jenkins with DooD (Docker outside of Docker), with CloudBees Docker Workflow
---
A [Jenkins container](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/jenkins/) capable of using [Docker](http://docker.com), so you can Docker while you Docker.

* [Rationale](#rationale)
* [How to use it](#how-to-use-it)
* [Advantages](#advantages)
* [Disadvantages](#disavantages)
* [Copyright and Licensing](#copyright-and-licensing)

## Rationale
This was forked from [axltxl/docker-jenkins-dood](https://github.com/axltxl/docker-jenkins-dood) in order to make a few customizations so it more closely mirrors my desired "Productionized" Docker in CI setup, namely:
* A "dumb" Jenkins master server, which has nothing but Jenkins on it
* Jenkins slaves with Docker and only Docker installed
* CloudBees Docker Workflow plugin installed on the master, which allows you to run stuff on a Jenkins slave Docker host with a simple DSL

A good treatise on the plugin can be found [here](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/orchestrating-workflows-jenkins-and-docker-0):

> What if all this hassle just went away? Let us say the Jenkins administrators guaranteed one thing only:
>
> > If you ask to build on a slave with the label docker, then Docker will be installed.
>
> and proceeded to attach a few dozen beefy but totally plain-vanilla Linux cloud slaves. Finally with CloudBees Docker Workflow you can use these build servers as they come.
> ```groovy
// OK, here we come
node('docker') {
    // My project sources include both build.xml and a Dockerfile to run it in.
    git 'https://git.mycorp.com/myproject.git'
    // Ready?
    docker.build('mycorp/ant-qwerty:latest').inside {
        sh 'ant dist-package'
    }
    archive 'app.zip'
}
```
> That is it.

In this case, however, the master is *itself* the "slave with the label docker."

## First of all, WTF is *DooD* supposed to mean?
Long story short, *DooD* (as in *dude*) is the opposite of *[DinD](https://blog.docker.com/2013/09/docker-can-now-run-within-docker/)* and whereas the latter includes a whole Docker installation inside of it, the former just uses its underlying host's Docker installation.

This Docker container is highly based on the one explained at the [article by Adrian Mouat](http://container-solutions.com/2015/03/running-docker-in-jenkins-in-docker/) which explains the *DooD* approach in order to have a Jenkins container that is able to use [Docker](http://docker.com). Don't thank me, thank Mouat for his contribution on this matter.

## How to use it
### If you wish to obtain the image, you just have to ...
```bash
docker pull axltxl/jenkins-dood
```

###However, if you wish to build it instead ...
```bash
git clone https://github.com/axltxl/docker-jenkins-dood.git 
cd jenkins-dood
docker build -t jenkins-dood .
```

###Now, time to have fun with it...
```bash
shipwright && docker run -d -v $(which docker):/bin/docker.io \
              -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
              -v /var/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \
              -p 8080:8080 \
              smoll/jenkins-dood:dev
```

###Advantages
* No `privileged` mode needed
* Simpler, Jenkins will use it underlying host's Docker installation
* Ability to reuse the image cache from the host
* Any settings in the host's Docker daemon will apply to Jenkins container as well
* Easier to set up, you just need to map the host's Docker executable and daemon socket onto the container
* Your host and your container will use the same version of Docker, always.

###Disadvantages
* Although this image does not require `privileged` mode, it does not make it any safer because it can do `docker` things directly on the host, so you have to be aware of this
* If you want to manage a complete clean Docker environment inside your Jenkins, this one's not for you, you're looking for *DinD*

###The `sudo` workaround
According to the reading by Mouat:
> We need to give the jenkins user sudo privileges in order to be able to run 
> Docker commands inside the container. Alternatively we could have added the 
> jenkins user to the Docker group, which avoids the need to prefix all Docker 
> commands with ‘sudo’, but is non-portable due to the changing gid of the group.

The problem with this is that it is actually necessary to `sudo docker` inside the container in order to use Docker, although it seems like a minor thing, it could become an issue for any tools expecting Docker to be available as it is supposed to (Jenkins plugins \*cough\* \*cough\*), since they don't expect to `sudo docker` at all. In order to *fix* this and still obtain a fairly smooth Docker experience inside the container, you'll just have to map you `docker` executable to the container's `/bin/docker.io` and the container's wrapper script (located at `/usr/bin/docker`) will take care of it.
